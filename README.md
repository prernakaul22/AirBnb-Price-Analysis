relationship between features and potential factors affecting price of an Airbnb accommodation. 

The data was colleted through scraping APIs of Airbnb listings, data of nearby competitive hotels and Yelp for restaurant data to estimate the popularity of a locality. Various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques are applied to have a general understading of machine learning algorithms.
